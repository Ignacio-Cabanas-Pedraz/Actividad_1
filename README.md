The contents of this repository are from a task for my Bachelor's Degree. In this task, we want to count the number of cells in a certain image. Cells come in many
shapes and sizes and therefore AI models should be able to recognise them in spite of these many different variations. Cell morphology is an important aspect that can help
identify parasites, calculate mortality rates, and many more functions.

The code in this repository is not all my creation, it is shared with a former colleague of mine, and it has been modified by code revisioning tools to properly work, 
as the aim is not to learn the code by heart but rather study its effects on the task at hand.
